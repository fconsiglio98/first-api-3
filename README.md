# Exercise - Spring Boot - First API 3
* write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that has:
  * a `StringController` that:
    * is mapped on `strings`
    * returns the concatenation of 2 strings (the first is mandatory, the second is not) params
      * handle the case where the second string is null (we want to return just the first string)
* test the API endpoint with `Postman`, executing 2 `GET` requests:
  * with just the first param
  * with both the params
* **note for reviewers**: view `FirstApi3.postman_collection.json` in the root folder for the `Postman` calls
